BRIEF API DOCUMENTATION
=======================

- All requests require POST, even 'last'.
- The URL is /api/[method]/[api_key], where /[api_key] is not mandatory. If you
	don't specify api_key or you specify a wrong one, you will have the same
	rights as a non-logged in user in the website: you can't read hidden quotes
	and you can't post a quote without being reviewed first.
- POST variables marked with * are mandatory.
